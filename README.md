# ShiftPlanner
Shift Planner is an application that aims to plan the shifts that need to be planned uninterruptedly in the most accurate way. The main purpose of this application is to facilitate the work of managers, to ensure that employees are also included in shift planning, to minimize the conflicts and disruptions that may occur in the working order, and to enable everyone to easily follow their working hours.

Shift Planner Algorithm assign employees to shifts according to their off-day preferences. First, algorithm tries to assign employees to their first preference. After that, those who cannot be assigned by first preference are tried to be assigned according to their second preference. If there are still unassigned employees.They are collected in an array which is called unassigned. Unassigned workers are then allocated to the remaining shifts randomly.

Shortly Shift Planner is a web application which automatically assigns shifts to workers using its own algorithm.
